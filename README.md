# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to identify how much revenue was made from rides facilited through Pyber, a hypothetical ride hailing company, using data provided between Jan 1 and April 29. I used a breakdown of city type to offer the audience composed of senior managment with a month by month trend analysis to help them locate prospective opportunities for business growth. Herein I use the month by month analysis to offer recommendations informed by the the month and town type. To conduct this analysis I used .csv files provided to me by my hypothetical employer and python/juptyer notebook.
